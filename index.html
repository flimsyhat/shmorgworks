      <h3>Hi! i'm Morgan Kelley, aka Shmoo.</h3>
      <p class="pa3 mw7">I grew up on the eastern shore of Maryland, in Salisbury, with 3 brothers. I was a quiet, introverted kid who enjoyed many hours outside, reading, writing and tinkering with nuts & bolts to make small figurines. Athletics and academics grew in my focus as I grew older, and college in DC at GW University was a time for me to grow socially. After college, without a specific intention for my biology degree, I returned home and returned to the childhood idea of learning how to weld in order to make more metal art. I took a welding class through a nearby community college and worked for the instructor as a production welder for nearly two years. Having no real art education other than my momâ€™s paintings and her encouragement of my creativity, I decided to take a sculpture class at the local university. Through many hours of drawing and ideating, I finally made the leap to begin my own art production this past New Year (2020).  I have been excited to see the support and response I have already received, through sales, awards, a magazine feature, and mostly kind words. I am incredibly grateful to have wound my way to this point, to be creating in this way, and continuing to further my art.</p>
      <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
      <p class="mw7">My work takes steel rod, meant for a functional or structural purpose, and reforms it into a textured aesthetic image. Welding itself can be a grimy, laborious, hazardous process, but something about watching metal melt and transform right before your eyes is endlessly fascinating. My work presents metal in a form that does not match its intended function. I find this beautiful, the re-imagination of identity. Human beings are constantly seeking their purpose and trying to align themselves to it, trying to cement their identity. We constantly seek for better functionality and in doing so transform ourselves, sculpt ourselves, become, as much as we can, happy, efficient creatures of form and function. We seek and see meaning in everything, even as simple as lines, reflections on the wall. Especially if it is presented as art. In finding our identities and purpose, our imagination processes what we see, filling in the blanks of a story, our story, seeing images in lines, and grasping meaning.</p>
